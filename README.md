# project-carruso-client

The frontend for a MERN website I started for a car dealer.

It uses React, styled-components, Bootstrap, Font Awesome and [validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator). It communicates with the Express backend and the MongoDB database via a REST API.

For tooling, this project uses TypeScript, Babel with several plugins for performance optimization, ESLint with several plugins, and Prettier. It is bootstrapped with create-react-app.

The repo with the backend of this project is at [aplietexe/project-carruso-server](https://github.com/aplietexe/project-carruso-server).

The project didn't go through at the end because of limited funds, which is why it is unpolished and most of the admin functionality is missing. What is build of the admin panel can be accessed at [/admin/cars](https://carruso-client.vercel.app/admin/cars).

There is a live version running [here](https://carruso-client.vercel.app/).
